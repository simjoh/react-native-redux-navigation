This is a simple example of react-navigation working together with redux. It is basically the tutorial by github user FransiscoMSM and the original repositoriet can be found at https://github.com/weareredlight/react-native-tutorials.git. 

I just updated the code to work with expo by updating the package.json and changing the impoort of PropTypes. This repo also contains some extra stack to navigate around.
